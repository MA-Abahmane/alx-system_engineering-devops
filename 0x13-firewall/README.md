# Firewall Project


## Overview

This repository contains a firewall implementation designed to enhance the security of your network by controlling incoming and outgoing traffic based on a set of predefined rules. Firewalls are a crucial component of network security and play a vital role in protecting your infrastructure from unauthorized access, malicious activities, and potential threats.

## Features

- **Rule-Based Filtering:** This firewall uses a rule-based approach to filter network traffic. You can define rules that specify which packets are allowed and which should be blocked.

- **Packet Inspection:** The firewall inspects each incoming and outgoing packet, evaluating it against the defined rules to determine whether it should be allowed or denied.

- **Port and Protocol Filtering:** You can configure rules based on specific ports and protocols, allowing you to control traffic at a granular level.

- **Logging:** The firewall logs all incoming and outgoing packets, making it easier to monitor network activity and troubleshoot issues.

- **Customization:** You can easily customize the firewall rules to match the specific security requirements of your network.
